With LocalStack, we can run our AWS applications or Lambdas entirely on our local machine without connecting to a remote cloud provider! Whether we are testing complex CDK applications or Terraform configurations, or just beginning to learn about AWS services, LocalStack helps speed up and simplify our testing and development workflow.

#### [Project 3 AWS Cloud Project Bootcamp](https://github.com/madhusudhanbn/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023)

We are building a micro-blogging platform named CRUDDUR. Unlike Twitter, Instagram or Snapchat, CRUDDUR is a true ephemeral-first micro-blogging platform. It will allow users to post updates, thoughts, and photos that automatically expire after a period of time, ensuring that your personal information and conversations stay relevant and in the moment. CRUDDUR, with expiring posts, will reduce trust and safety issues by limiting the amount of personal information online, decrease the potential for cyberbullying and harassment and improve the overall user experience through its features.
